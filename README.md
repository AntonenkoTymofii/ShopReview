# ShopReview

This is Pet-project. It will take different goods from different shops, show you commentaries from sites about this product from all shops.

This project will be created by Java Spring Boot (back-end), JS Angular (front-end) and PostgreSQL (database). This repository currently contains the implementation of the REST CRUD API. REST CRUD API is created by Java Spring Boot. I use Hibernate and Flyway to connect migration and PostgreSQL database. Also prototype of DB you can see in PlantUML files. Unitests will be implemented later. Later I will start developing front part of project.
