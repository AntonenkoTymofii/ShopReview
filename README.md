# ShopReview

This is Pet-project. It will take different goods from different shops, show you commentaries from sites about this product from all shops.

This project will be created by Java Spring Boot (back-end), JS Angular (front-end) and PostgreSQL (database). This repository currently contains the implementation of the REST CRUD API. REST CRUD API is created by Java Spring Boot. I use Hibernate and Flyway to connect migration and PostgreSQL database. Also prototype of DB you can see in PlantUML files. Unitests will be implemented later. Later I will start developing front part of project. 

My project will be created to search and compare products in various online stores and calculate their prices and quantities. It will also be possible to write comments on various products at once on the websites of several online stores. In the future, it is planned to add filtering of other people's comments to various products. It is also possible to create a product rating and save their description.

The project was created in order to facilitate the selection and search of the necessary products in several stores and to collect all products and stores in one site. This will make it easier and faster to compare and choose where to buy a product.
